Hello! This zip file is Daniel Burnayev's submission for CS 455 Project 1, with my-dns-client.c being a DNS client that can query an existing DNS server for domain name to IP address translation (as the project says it should).

To compile my-dns-client.c to run/test it, type the following out in your cmd:
gcc my-dns-client.c -o my-dns-client

TO run/test the executable that comes from compiling my-dns-client.c, type the following in your cmd:
./my-dns-client <hostname-of-your-choice>
